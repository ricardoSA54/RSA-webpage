                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>August 2015: </b> University College of London, Institute for Liver and Digestive Heath, London
                                <p>I completed a 5 week Internship to develop and optimize a protocol to accurately and rapidly detect and treat early infection in acute liver failure and sepsis patients by photodynamic therapy. This project involved the development of a sensitive early detection method based on qPCR to help determine the timing when the photodynamic therapy should be applied and to accurately and rapidly detect early infections. I was supervised by Dr. Christophe Espirito Santo. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Nov. 2015 - Jan. 2016: </b> University of Porto, Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology (IBMC), Porto
                                <p>Concomitantly to my studies, I completed a voluntary Internship in Dr. Paulo Pereira’s research group for “Cell Growth and Differentiation”. During this time, I acquired experience in Drosophila melanogaster culture growth and maintenance. I also learned how to perform genotype crossings, fly selection and dissection.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Feb. 2016 - June. 2016: </b> University of Stockholm, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Stockholm
                                <p>Bachelor project in Prof. Martin Ott’s group: “Investigation of cristae pH in yeast”. During this research project, I tagged proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae known to be preferentially located at various sites in the cell with ratiometric pHluorin2, a pH-sensitive GFP derivative. These constructed strains were used to map intra-mitochondrial proton pH and obtain a comprehensive picture of in vivo pH while testing district conditions such as substrate availability. We observed the existence of a proton concentration gradient that increases along the cristae.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Nov. 2016 - Feb. 2017: </b> Ludwig Maximilian’s University, Gene Center, Munich
                                <p>I completed an 8-week Internship in Prof. Daniel Wilson’s research group to study the interaction of YqjD and YbcJ with the Escherichia coli ribosome. During this internship, I designed plasmids carrying the proteins of interest with a Strep-Tag. I optimized their overexpression in a BL21(DE3) system, and performed sucrose gradient fractionation. Our results suggested possible interaction between the 70S ribosome and YqjD, and the 30S and YbcJ.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Nov. 2017: </b> Ludwig Maximilian’s University, Faculty of Biology, Munich
                                <p>I did a 4-week rotation in Dr. Bart Nieuwenhuis’s newly established research group in which I contributed to the development of Schizosaccharomyces pombe strains with single nucleotide polymorphisms as well as additional knock-out stains used for experimental evolution.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Feb. 2018: </b> Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Munich
                                <p>I did a 4-week internship in Dr. Hannes Mutschler’s research group working with self-replicating ribozyme systems based on the hairpin ribozyme. I tested the assembly of the replicative system using a freeze-thaw cycler, while focusing on a design incorporating an internal fluorescent FAM tag. I also worked with DNAzyme as an alternative to EDC 3’ 2,3-cyclization of RNA oligomers. I was supervised by Dr. Kristian Le Vay.</p>

                            <li><b>May 2018 - Nov. 2018:</b> Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Munich
                                <p>I did my master thesis in Dr. Hannes Mutschler’s research group. I focused on the optimization of the self-replicating ribozyme design by in vitro selection for improved ligation junctions. In parallel, I worked on a simplified system with less junctions. I worked under the supervision of Dr. Kristian Le Vay.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Nov. 2019 - present:</b> Laboratory of Evolution and Biological Diversity (EDB), Toulouse
                                <p>For my PhD, I am undertaking an interdisciplinary project at the crossroads of biology and the social sciences with the goal of conducting a comparative study of conformist learning in humans and non-human species (Drosophila melanogaster). I aim to gain insights into animal culture and social learning, and ultimately achieve a better understanding of the deep nature of human conformity. My research is performed in collaboration with researchers at IAST (Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse) and CRCA (Centre de Researches sur la Cognition Animale). The project is funded by CRNS and jointly supervised by Prof. Etienne Danchin (EDB), Dr.Arnaud Pocheville (EDB), Dr. Guillaume Isabel (CRCA), Dr. Sabine Nöbel (IAST) and Prof. Paul Seabright (IAST).</p>

                    </p>
                    <h4>Laboratory competences</h4>
                    <p>I have extensive experience with several model organisms, including culturing and handling of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Drosophila melanogaster and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

                        Additionally, I can prepare competent cells of different organisms and I am proficient in several in vivo techniques such as chemical transformation, cell lysis, drop dilution, sucrose gradient fractionation and general genomic manipulation and cloning.

                        In conjunction with vector design, I can use these skills for protein tagging, overexpression, precipitation and purification employing several strategies. I have experience with fluorescence tags such as different GFP variants and tagging for isolation with the strep tag. I have a grasp of bright field and fluorescence microscopy.

                        I have experience with PCR, real time qPCR, RT-PCR, stitch PCR colony PCR and MEGAWHOP cloning. I am also proficient in UV/visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. I have worked with different gel types (agarose, SDS-PAGE and TBU) and can perform gel extraction.

                        I have experience working with RNA including sequence design and in vitro transcription. I am also trained in in vitro selection.

                        I have a lot experience in animal behavioral experiments using Drosophila melanogaster and have helped develop video recording and analysis protocols to study this species. I have also experience designing and conducting online experiments, particularly in the field of human social psychology.
